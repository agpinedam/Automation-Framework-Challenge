# Automation-Framework-Challenge

SUT: The Movie Database – API Layer (https://www.themoviedb.org/)
Present a test automation framework for the SUT.
Requirements:
• 5 dummy test cases (they can be console messages, no need to use Rest-Assured).
• Must use Java.
• Must implement at least 1 design pattern.
• You must send me the GitHub repo BEFORE 4:00 PM on Friday 27th

Evaluation Criteria:
• I will be asking the following questions:
- What type of framework did you choose?
- How are you handling the data?
- How are you structuring your framework? And why?
- What tools did you choose? And why?
• The test cases MUST be appropriate to the API and work properly. I will consider the 
depth of the TCs, the value they provide, and the complexity of them.
• CLEAN CODE
• Quality of the overall presentation (be secure and professional, even when you don’t 
know something).

Bonus points:
• Bonus points will be awarded in accordance with the reasoning behind your choices, the 
overall structure of your framework and complexity of your TCs
